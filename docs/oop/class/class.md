## Overview
In Django, you have the option to use either class-based views (CBVs) or function-based views (FBVs). Class-based views are indeed often associated with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because they allow for better reuse and composition(modularity) of code by utilizing inheritance and mixins.

???+ quote "Quote"
    "Building complex views by combining simpler, reusable components." - Django Design Philosophy/OOP Principles

Function-based views, on the other hand, are more procedural in nature. They are simpler and more explicit, which can make them easier to understand for certain tasks. They are not generally categorized under a specific programming paradigm like OOP, but they are more aligned with the procedural or functional programming styles.

### Class-Based View Example
Here's a simple class-based view that handles HTTP GET requests:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class MyView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse('Hello, this is a class-based view.')
```

OR

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views import View

class MyView(View):
    """
    MyView is a Django class-based view that handles HTTP GET requests
    and renders a template.

    Attributes:
        template_name (str): The name of the template to be rendered.
                             Defaults to 'about/about.html'.

    Methods:
        get(request): Handles GET requests and renders the specified
                      template.
    """
    template_name = 'about/about.html'
    
    def get(self, request):
        return render(request, self.template_name)
```

### Function-Based View Example
And here's its equivalent function-based view:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def my_view(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello, this is a function-based view.')
```

OR

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    """
    Handle HTTP GET requests and render a specified template.

    This function-based view takes an HttpRequest object as input and
    returns an HttpResponse object after rendering the 'about/about.html'
    template.

    Args:
        request (HttpRequest): The request object from the client.

    Returns:
        HttpResponse: The rendered template as an HTTP response.

    """
    template_name = 'about/about.html'
    return render(request, template_name)

```

### Logic and Sense

1. **Class-Based Views (OOP)**: When you're building large or complex applications, CBVs can offer advantages in terms of reusability and composability. You can create base views that handle common patterns and then extend them for specialized use-cases. Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is well applied here.

2. **Function-Based Views**: These are straightforward and easy to understand, making them suitable for simple use-cases or for developers who are just getting started with Django. They make the logic explicit and are usually easier to follow for simple tasks. Uses "Explicit is better than implicit" principle, one of the core tenets of Python's philosophy.

In summary:

- Class-based views are more about "what it is" (e.g., it's a DetailView, it's a ListView).
- Function-based views are more about "what it does" (e.g., it handles a GET request in this specific way).

Both can achieve the same end result but offer different organizational structures for your code.
