Developer's Snack is a section I developed over time because I found that various rules, standards, and code snippets were easy to forget. For that reason, I decided to create guidelines and extra documentation for myself, where I could return for that knowledge or inspiration. That's how Developer's Snack came into existence, and since then, I've applied the same section to all my projects.

As you can see in the navbar of this section, there are different entries that are useful not only for me but for the entire community as well.

Feel free to navigate around and find what you need!
