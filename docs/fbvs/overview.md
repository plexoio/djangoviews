Welcome to the FBVs (Function-Based Views) section, where we will navigate through various functions used in actual production code in Django.

Although not all the code is fully efficient or polished, it will serve its purpose, which is to help us understand what's going on behind scenes. This will ultimately help us comprehend what's right in front of our eyes.

Gaining this understanding will enhance our versatility as coders, fueling our creativity and problem-solving skills.
