- I meticulously analyze my own code, with a preference for using OOP through class-based views. However, I'm working as well with function-based views.

- The aim of this channel is to foster attention to detail, enhance comprehension, and promote versatility in Python coding, specifically within the Django framework.

- To prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed, commonly experienced on other social platforms, I employ progressive disclosure and get straight to the point.
